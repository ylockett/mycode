user_input = input('Please enter an IPv4 IP address:')

## the line below creates a single string that is passed to print()
# print("You told me the IPv4 address is:" + user_input)

## print() can be given a series of objects seperated by a comma
print("You told me the IPv4 address is:", user_input)


#The first line should collect and store input from the user. Ask the user for the ‘vendor name’ associated with the device. Use any variable name you would like.
#Use a second line of code to print the input you just collected from the user.
